#Crowdfunder

Crowdfunder is a clone of [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com), built during [Bitmaker's](http://bitmaker.co) web development immersive bootcampt, by a 4-person team.

It uses Ruby 2.3 and Rails 4.2.5, and requires no API keys or other dependencies. Just clone, bundle, migrate, and run!
